# URL Shortener

Implement a Python command line tool that performs URL shortening and expansion.

The tool has two primary functions:

1. Given a complete URL, return a shortened URL.
2. Given a shortened URL, return the complete URL.

The shortened URLs has an expiration time of N seconds; once the time has passed, the link should no longer be valid for the expand
command, but the original url could be minified again.

## Command parameters:

- Parameter --minify=https://www.example.com/path?q=search
- Parameter --expand=https://myurlshortener.com/fstp4

If a complete URL has already been shortened and is not expired, the tool should return the same shortened URL. If a shortened URL
doesnâ€™t exist or is expired, it should return an appropriate message.

## Tech Stack:

- Do not use pre-existing libraries for generating shortened URLs.
- MongoDB for storage.
- Unit tests using pytest.
- Docker for containerization.
- Publish on GitHub
